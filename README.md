Affiliation: Harvard University, Institute for Applied Computational Science
Authors: Austin Nguyen, Erin Tomlinson, Eric Hemold, Aloysius Lim, Molly Liu 

We introduce a repository for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in partnership with Wadhwani AI.

# Overview  


# Data Preparation 

* We sorted the data into in-distribution (ID), edge case (EC), and out-of-distribution (OOD). We define these categories as follows etc etc 

# Usage 

## Convolutional autoencoder (CAE)

Training

Evaluation 

## Bayesian Mixture Model & Relative Mahalanobis Distance


# License
